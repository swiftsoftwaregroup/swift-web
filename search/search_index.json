SSG has been at the forefront of algorithm design and optimization for over 2 decades. Our experts collaborate with world leading research centers and academics to develop and maintain algorithms used in multitude of applications. </p> <p>SSG's custom algorithm development targets the configurations of your specific environment and your own problem types. Many aspects are considered including processor (CPU, coprocessor or GPU), memory configurations, communications networks and problem sizes, runtime windows, tolerances, areas of interest and much more.</p>"},{"location":"services/#code-modernization","title":"Code Modernization","text":"<p>Software modernization is often a required step for an application to be able to effectively use GPUs (e.g., from NVIDIA or AMD),or  Intel\u2019s Xeon Phi, and other many-core processors. However, software modernization also delivers significant performance advantages on more traditional processors, such as Intel\u2019s Xeon family.</p> <p>SSG can help you improve the cost-effectiveness and performance of your numerical computing in science, engineering, finance, analytics and more.</p>"},{"location":"services/#software-optimization","title":"Software Optimization","text":"<ul> <li>Is your application software suffering from poor performance today?</li> <li>Do you know if your application software is running at full potential on your current computing systems?</li> <li>Is your application software ready to exploit future computing technology?</li> </ul> <p>The overwhelming proportion of performance from all mainstream current and future processors comes from parallel processing techniques. In addition, system architectures have increasingly complex memory hierarchies and performance characteristics. Software must be modified, or \u2018modernized\u2019 in order to exploit this hardware complexity to access the potential performance. </p> <p>SSG can assess your code to identify the likely value of porting to GPU or many-core processors. Where performance or cost benefits are possible, SSG can port your code to GPUs or other many-core coprocessors using appropriate standards and languages - e.g. CUDA, OpenCL or OpenMP. We can also advise on appropriate alternative algorithms that may be better suited for use on many-core / coprocessor / GPU processors.</p>"},{"location":"services/#cloud-migration","title":"Cloud Migration","text":"<p>The flexibility of the cloud allows the option to adapt both the application as well as the platform upon which it runs.
